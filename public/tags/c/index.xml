While I couldn’t dive deeply into every aspect, I gained valuable exposure, particularly to eBPF, which several colleagues were using for research and internal tools. That sparked my interest in the technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After completing my internship, I began building an eBPF based monitoring tool to understand the space better. Although the initial version was completed, I didn’t revisit it for over a year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Smart Network Interface Card on FPGA – Major Project Edition</title><link>https://utkar5hm.github.io/posts/smart-nic-on-fpga/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://utkar5hm.github.io/posts/smart-nic-on-fpga/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/Utkar5hM/fpga-based-packet-processing-unit">Project GitHub Link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I’ll walk through how we built a Smart NIC on an FPGA as part of our final-year major project. This project was developed with my teammates &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmay-sharma-9a68b8200/">Chinmay&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muthuku37/">Muthukumar&lt;/a>. The concept stemmed from our prior exposure to XDP/eBPF, which led us to explore hardware offloading. While our initial goals were ambitious, the timeline and complexity forced us to adapt along the way.&lt;/p>
