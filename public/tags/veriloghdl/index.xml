&lt;p>In this post, I’ll walk through how we built a Smart NIC on an FPGA as part of our final-year major project. This project was developed with my teammates &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmay-sharma-9a68b8200/">Chinmay&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muthuku37/">Muthukumar&lt;/a>. The concept stemmed from our prior exposure to XDP/eBPF, which led us to explore hardware offloading. While our initial goals were ambitious, the timeline and complexity forced us to adapt along the way.&lt;/p>

HDLs are used to model hardware elements very concurrently. Verilog HDL and VHDL are the most popular HDLs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digital circuits are described at Registers Transfer Level (RTL) using HDL. Then logic synthesis tool will generate details of gates and interconnection to implement courses. This synthesized result can be used for fabrication by having placement and routing components, and later its functionality can be verified using simulation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
