HDLs are used to model hardware elements very concurrently. Verilog HDL and VHDL are the most popular HDLs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digital circuits are described at Registers Transfer Level (RTL) using HDL. Then logic synthesis tool will generate details of gates and interconnection to implement courses. This synthesized result can be used for fabrication by having placement and routing components, and later its functionality can be verified using simulation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
