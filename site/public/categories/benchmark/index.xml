      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it all started at IRIS NITK, where I had the chance to work with some seriously cracked individuals, and we were testing out different distributed strategies for MariaDB. While I didn’t have a ton of time to dive super deep, I was picking up some gems here and there. The real kicker? A bunch of the guys were working on eBPF-based tools for their own projects/academics, and that’s where I first got exposed to eBPF. Safe to say, the tech rizz was strong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
