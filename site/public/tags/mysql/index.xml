      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my time at IRIS NITK, I had the opportunity to work with a talented group of peers exploring distributed strategies for MariaDB. While I couldn’t dive deeply into every aspect, I gained valuable exposure, particularly to eBPF, which several colleagues were using for research and internal tools. That sparked my interest in the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After completing my internship, I began building an eBPF based monitoring tool to understand the space better. Although the initial version was completed, I didn’t revisit it for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
