<p>NahamCon EU CTF 2022 was a 24-Hour CTF contest hosted by <a href="https://justhacking.com/">JustHacking</a> on December 16th, 12:00 PM - December 17th, 12:00 PM PST. Our team <code>T34M #4294967295</code>, consisting of me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amogh-umesh-100159226">Anorak</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-r-rishi-319790205">Jokesta</a>, participated and secured 27th place in the CTF. Here are the writeups for some of the flags we captured.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>So this is supposed to progressively get &ldquo;harder&rdquo; and has a time cap per equation. Give your answer to the nearest 4 decimal places unless there&rsquo;s a trailing 0.</p>
<p>Upon visiting the given link, we come up with a page with an arithmetic question in an image which we need to solve and submit within a decreasing time limit. Each correct answer will increase your score by 1, and any wrong answer resets it back to 0.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/ctf/nahamconeu22/2022-12-18_15-38.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<p>We used Pytesseract to generate strings from images and used eval to solve the equations. We had to grayscale the image and whitelist characters in an arithmetic equation for better accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="final-script">Final Script:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pytesseract
import requests
import cv2
import numpy as np
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import sys

BASE_URL = &quot;http://challenge.nahamcon.com:&quot;+ str(sys.argv[1]) +&quot;/&quot;
flag_found=False
while not flag_found:
    img_response = requests.get(BASE_URL + &quot;/static/eqn.png&quot;)
    image = cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(img_response.content, np.uint8), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    config = '--oem 0 --psm 6 -c tessedit_char_whitelist=0123456789+-*/^()'

    arithmetic_problem = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng', config=config)
    result =0
    try:
        result = eval(arithmetic_problem.replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;))
    except:
        print(arithmetic_problem)
        break
    result = round(result, 4)
    data = {&quot;eqn_ans&quot;: result}
    response = requests.post(BASE_URL, data=data)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    count_element = soup.find('p', class_='count')
    print(count_element.text + &quot;: &quot; +  str(result))

<h1 id="the-space-between-us---miscellaneous">The Space between Us - Miscellaneous:</h1>
<h3 id="description-1">Description:</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt this close to a character before. I hope the feeling is mutual&hellip;</p>
<p>Escalate your privileges and retrieve the flag from the root&rsquo;s home directory.</p>
<h3 id="approach-1">Approach:</h3>
<p>We were given an NC command to connect to a machine, There were only limited tools installed into the system, And for the Hell, even cd wasn&rsquo;t present. We could not use the space character directly as it was getting filtered out. We had to use <code>${IFS}</code> instead, an env variable for space. Though this worked in most cases, it was terrible. Anorak switched to a python reverse shell as it was installed in the system, making it easier to work around. We discovered that the `/etc/password is writable by the user, so we added a new root-privileged user and gained root.</p>

<h3 id="description-2">Description:</h3>
<p>These files were on a USB I bought from a pawn shop.</p>
<h3 id="approach-2">Approach.</h3>
<p>We were given 2 files, <code>ct.enc</code> and a binary file called a program. <code>ct.enc</code> consisted of encrypted text. Upon analyzing with ghidra, we found that it performed AES 128 encryption on the input. The key for it was generated during the execution. We reused the reversed code from the binary to regenerate the key and decrypt our message.</p>

<h3 id="approach-3">Approach:</h3>
<p>We were given source code, and URL to a PHP(Apache) based web server. It had a file upload functionality and blacklisted several PHP files but not <code>.htaccess</code>, so we used htshells to generate a web shell, uploaded it and obtained the flag.</p>

<p>These bits are shapepshifting! I need some help getting them back to their original form. Someone told me this might be a Fibonacci LFSR.</p>

<p>:P I will see If I can add writeups for IP Man, RaaS and Dizzy, which were solved by Anorak. The rest we solved were pretty easy and self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Here&rsquo;s an eye hurting certificate from the event:</p>
