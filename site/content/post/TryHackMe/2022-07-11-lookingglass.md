(I don't remember looking at the output at all & so, I don't have a copy of it.)

So while the nmap results come out, I tried connecting to one of the ports via nc and found that its running  `SSH-2.0-dropbear`.

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/2.png)

I found this exploit which doesn't seem to work but I found interesting results trying to connect to one of the non standard ports:
[LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ucCvoDvdGY)

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/3.png)

For lower port ranges it replies with Lower and for higher, it replies with Higher.

So lets try to find the port in between and we might get something interesting.

After few tries, I was manually able to find the right port `9766` (hoping it to be the right serverrrrrrr!)

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/4.png)

So It results in some weird aff strings asking for a secret. uhh

From a simple google search it's obvious that it's vignere ciphered text of the Jabberwocky poem due to a reddit link with somebody asking about it. ;-; 

on dcode.fr, I was able to find the decryption key by inserting the top 3 paragraphs using the automatic decryption. It also meets the original poem.


![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/5.png)

Decryption key: `THEALPHABETCIPHER`

So we now have our secret:

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/6.png)

SECRET: `bewareTheJabberwock`

Entering the secret returns possible credentials.

I can login with the credentials . :P

reversing this string, we get our first flag:

## Privilege Escalation(s)

hmm, this machine could be vulnerable to known kernel exploits but lets go with How ig its supposedly should be done; idk..

So there are 5 other non root users. I  Cannot cd into any of their directories.

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/10.png)


Hmm, so theres a cronjob to execute a .sh file on reboot and we have sudo perms to execute `reboot`.

![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/11.png)

xD  Tried `sudo reboot -h` and the server's down now not being able to ssh into the server.  

So, I restarted the machine just to realize that the password resets every reboot so the server didn't exactly have any issues but that I needed to restart the entire process and get the password.

Anyways the cronjob runs as tweedledum.

created the following script:
![](/assets/img/thm/lookingglass/12.png)

:P rebooted the server again. :o Hoping to get a connection trhough `tweededum`,

Here we go:

‘You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice. ‘Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called “Jabberwocky”?’

‘Let’s hear it,’ said Humpty Dumpty. ‘I can explain all the poems that were ever invented—and a good many that haven’t been invented just yet.’

This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:

     ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
‘That’s enough to begin with,’ Humpty Dumpty interrupted: ‘there are plenty of hard words there. “Brillig” means four o’clock in the afternoon—the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.’

‘That’ll do very well,’ said Alice: ‘and “slithy”?’

‘Well, “slithy” means “lithe and slimy.” “Lithe” is the same as “active.” You see it’s like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.’

‘I see it now,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully: ‘and what are “toves”?’

‘Well, “toves” are something like badgers—they’re something like lizards—and they’re something like corkscrews.’

‘They must be very curious looking creatures.’

‘They are that,’ said Humpty Dumpty: ‘also they make their nests under sun-dials—also they live on cheese.’

‘And what’s the “gyre” and to “gimble”?’

‘To “gyre” is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To “gimble” is to make holes like a gimlet.’

‘And “the wabe” is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?’ said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.

‘Of course it is. It’s called “wabe,” you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it—’

‘And a long way beyond it on each side,’ Alice added.

‘Exactly so. Well, then, “mimsy” is “flimsy and miserable” (there’s another portmanteau for you). And a “borogove” is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round—something like a live mop.’

‘And then “mome raths”?’ said Alice. ‘I’m afraid I’m giving you a great deal of trouble.’

‘Well, a “rath” is a sort of green pig: but “mome” I’m not certain about. I think it’s short for “from home”—meaning that they’d lost their way, you know.’

‘And what does “outgrabe” mean?’

‘Well, “outgrabing” is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you’ll hear it done, maybe—down in the wood yonder—and when you’ve once heard it you’ll be quite content. Who’s been repeating all that hard stuff to you?’

‘I read it in a book,’ said Alice. ‘But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by—Tweedledee, I think it was.’

‘As to poetry, you know,’ said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, ‘I can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that—’

‘Oh, it needn’t come to that!’ Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning.
